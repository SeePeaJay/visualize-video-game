  * I considered both the final 447 tutorial and officeofjane’s github example to create our bubble chart visual. I started mostly just copying what was presented in the tutorial and then removed all the elements related to links since our chart won’t have them. The result looked a bit off so I used the github example to see how the forces can be further tweaked. I repurposed the example’s collision force and strength selection functions to achieve the look of our chart.
